# Exercise

I do exercises 30-45 minutes twice a day

## Aerobic

- Stationary jogging when indoors
- Alternate jogging and running when outdoors

I use Fitbit to measure physical activity (usually measured in steps and high-intensity activity). 

- Target: 6 stars of Fitbit (10,000 steps), chunks of 10 minutes of high-intensity activity with 3 minutes of rest in between.
- Current: 4 stars of Fitbit (8,000 steps), chunks of 5 minutes of high-intensity activity with 3 minutes of rest in between.

## Anaerobic 

Applicable for every exercise session. 

- sit-ups: 10 reps, 3 sets 
- push-ups: 10 reps, 1 set  
- lunges: 10 reps (left and right leg = 1 rep), 3 sets
- squats: 10 reps, 3 sets

## Music

I believe music plays a huge role while exercising to help you stay inspired and take your mind out of the physical activity that you're doing. I usually play these on repeat.

- Rage of dust by Spyair
- Hikari are by Burnout Syndromes
- Fly high by Burnout Syndromes
