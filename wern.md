# Exercise

I do exercises 30-45 minutes twice a day

## Aerobic

- Jogging in place when indoors
- Alternate jogging and running when outdoors

I use Fitbit to measure physical activity (usually measured in steps and high-intensity activity). 

Target: 6 stars of Fitbit (10,000 steps), 10 minutes of high-intensity activity
Current: 4 stars of Fitbit (8,000 steps), 5 minutes of high-intensity activity

## Anaerobic 

Applicable for every exercise session.

- 50 sit-ups (target), 10 sit-ups (current) 
- 35 push-ups (target), 6 push-ups (current) 
- 50 crunches (target), 10 crunches (current)

## Music

I believe music plays a huge role while exercising to help you stay inspired and take your mind out of the physical activity that you're doing. I usually play these on repeat.

# Diet

I don't really plan my diet, I eat whatever is on the table. But I try to avoid fatty foods, eat fruit for every meal (usually banana), and stick to only one cup of rice.
